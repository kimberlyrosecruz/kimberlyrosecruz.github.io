      <h2 class="title1"><b>Border Collie</b></h2>


      <p class="p1">The <b>Border Collie</b> is among the most intelligent and smartest dog breeds out there. They are hard-workers and are often
      used to herd sheep up in countrysides around the world. They are medium-sized dogs filled with lots of energy and are also agile and strong,
    which is good for owners that who love to play with their pets. Despite their energy, Border Collies are also graceful and make loyal pets
  to their owners. However, because Border Collies were originally bred to herd sheep, they need lots of exercise and mental stimulation
to avoid behavior that could be problematic. If you are considering on adopting a Border Collie, make sure you give them lots of attention!</p>
