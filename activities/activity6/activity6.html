        <p class="pCard">Rabbits are ground dwellers that live in environments ranging from desert to tropical forest and wetland.
          Their natural geographic range in the Western Hemisphere encompasses the middle latitudes. In the Eastern
          Hemisphere rabbits are found in Europe, portions of Central and Southern Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Sumatra, and Japan.</p>

        <h2 class="titleCard">Chameleon</h2>
        <p class="pCard">Chameleon is part of family Chamaeleonidae and any of a group of primarily arboreal (tree-dwelling) Old World lizards best known for their ability to change body colour.
           Characteristics of chameleons include zygodactylous feet,
           acrodont dentition, eyes that move independently, atrophied venom glands that produce harmless venom, and a long,
           slender projectile tongue.</p>

            <h2 class="titleCard">Duck</h2>
            <p class="pCard">Duck, any of various species of relatively small, short-necked, large-billed waterfowl. In true ducks—i.e., those classified in the subfamily
              Anatinae in the waterfowl family Anatidae—the legs are placed rearward, as in swans, rather than forward, as in geese.</p>

        title="Coqui">
        <h2 class="titleCard">Coqui</h2>
        <p class="pCard">The Puerto Rican coqui (pronounced ko-kee) is a small arboreal frog that’s brown, yellow, or
          green in color. Its scientific genus name—Eleutherodactylus—means “free toes” because, unlike many frogs,
          the coqui doesn’t have webbed feet. These amphibians have special disks, or toe pads, on their feet that allow them to
          climb up vertical structures and cling to trees and leaves. </p>
